# Dismob-Travel-Application
Travel Application created on Android Studio 3.5 Canary Build

The author created a Travel Application that allows users to enter a Postcode and search for Bus Stops for the appropriate Post Code once they have use fingerprint authentication to log in to the Application. Once the user has found their Bus Stop based on the post code, they will then be able to get the Bus Times for the Bus Code that they entered. This Application will be able to get the bus information for a majority of buses in the United Kingdom using the Cage data and Transport API.
